# Idea word Separators
this NVDA addon fixes the problem with navigation by word in IntelliJ IDEA  and Android studio i.e. NVDA will not longer repead  several times the words that are adjacented punctuations and will just announce the current puctuation mark.
The Correct behavior is reached  by setting same word separators for NVDA that are used  in IntelliJ IDEA and android studio.

## IDEA settings
Addon will function correctly if navigation by words works in Windows style, i.e. When moving to the next or previous  word, the carriage is set on the first symbol of it.
inteleJ idea uses  the other word navigation mode by default  but a user can change this settings the following way:
1.  Open the settings from the file menu or press the keys Combination "ctrl+alt+s"
2. go to "edetor/general"
3. Choose the option "always jump the word start windows defoult" in the combobox "When movings by word".
