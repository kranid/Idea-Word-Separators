<p>this NVDA addon fixes the problem with navigation by words in IntelliJ IDEA and Android studio i.e. NVDA will not longer repeat several times some words. The Correct behavior is reached by setting the same word separators for NVDA that are used in IntelliJ IDEA and android studio.</p>
<h2 id="idea-settings">IDEA settings</h2>
<p>Addon will function correctly if navigation by words works in Windows style, i.e. When moving to the next or previous word, the carriage is set on the first symbol of it. inteleJ idea uses the other word navigation mode by default but a user can change this settings by the following way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the settings from the file menu or press the keys Combination "ctrl+alt+s"</li>
<li>go to "edetor/general"</li>
<li>Choose the option "always jump the word start windows defoult" in the combobox "When movings by word".</li>
</ol>
